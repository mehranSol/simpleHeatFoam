# simpleHeatFoam
In this extended solver, the energy equation has been added to the simpleFoam solver. It can be used to simulate steady-state, incompressible, and turbulent flow regarding heat transfer occured. It works like icoHeatFoam, but the temperature and velocity do not vary by time.

The programming language used is C++.
